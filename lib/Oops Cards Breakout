 *   - draw: return a random card from the cards array
 *
 * When you create an instance of your Deck class (i.e. in your constructor),
 * fill in the cards array with 52 instances of your Card class. You can do
 * this with a nested for loop - first loop through an array of all possible
 * suits, then loop through an array of all possible ranks. Inside your inner
 * loop, create an instance of your Card class and push it into the Deck's cards
 * array.
 *
 * Instantiate an instance of your Deck and start drawing random cards!
